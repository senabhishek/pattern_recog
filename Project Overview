Scenario 1: 
- Large training set
- Only trained once
- Applied to field
- At least 200 objects/class, at most 1000 objects/class
- 5% error rate

Scenario 2:
- Small training set
- Trained for each batch of cheques
- At most 10 objects/class
- 25% error rate

# of classes = 10
Total # of images/class = 2800
Total # of images in dataset = 28000
Pixel size/image = 128 pixels/128 pixels


FEATURE GENERATION

FEATURE SELECTION (FEATURE REDUCTION IF POSSIBLE)
- http://www.37steps.com/prhtml/prtools.html

CLASSIFIER DESIGN/CHOICE JUSTIFICATION
- Parametric (nmc, ldc, qdc, fisherc, loglc)
- Non-Parametric (knnc, parzenc)
- Advanced (Neural networks, SVM, 1-class classifiers)

SYSTEM EVALUATION

Questions:
1. show(a) not working on lab manual?
2. Are we expected to write our own classifier?
3. How do you select between pixel, feature or dissimilarity representations?
4. regionprops gives us a feature list - What other features can we define?
